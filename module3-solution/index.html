     <h3>Pasta</h3>
     <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. 
        Pasta was traditionally only made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils.
         While Asian noodles originated in China, pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy. <br><br>
         Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (Italian: pasta secca) and fresh (Italian: pasta fresca). 
         Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. 
         Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.
         Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.

      <h3>Soda</h3>
      <p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a cola soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.
         Coca-Cola ranked No. 94 in the 2024 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.
        Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study of 2023, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand. <br><br>
        Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. 
        In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.
        The name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).
        The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. 
        The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.
        The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas.

        <h3>Cake</h3>
        <p>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients and is usually baked. 
        In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies. <br><br>
        The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. 
        Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. 
        Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts, or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
